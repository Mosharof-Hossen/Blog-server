# Project Name : Blogify-server
# Api Link : [Link](https://bike-store-backend-flax.vercel.app/)

The goal of this Blogify-server is to develop a backend for a blogging platform where users can write, update, and delete their blogs. The system will have two roles: **Admin** and **User**. The Admin has special permissions to manage users and their blogs, while users can perform CRUD operations on their own blogs. The backend will include secure authentication, role-based access control, and a public API for viewing blogs with search, sort, and filter functionalities.
